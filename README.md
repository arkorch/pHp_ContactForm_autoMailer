# Homework 1: MULTI-PAGE PHP SITE

You will have one week to create a simple, multi-page PHP site that lists some data and includes a contact form that sends an email to you with the information the user has entered.

# Assignment Requirements:

You'll need to create a three-or-more page site, including the following pages:

- Contact Page
- Listing Page
- At least other page (could be a landing page, etc. Up to you!)

Your contact page will need to include a contact form that captures the user's name, email and message, and validates that information before sending it to you in an email. If the inputted information cannot be validated (ie. The email is invalid or empty, etc.) the script should return those errors to the previous page and show them to the user next to the inputs where the errors occurred.

Your listing page will need to display a list of data that comes from an array. You may either use the provided data array, or create your own; however, the data you display must include both a title and an image.

When building your pages, you will need to reuse and common pieces of markup / HTML (for example, headers / footers / navigation) by moving them to other files and re-using them for each page. You'll need to include navigation to navigate between each page, as well as a footer with your name â€“ both good chances to implement this.
